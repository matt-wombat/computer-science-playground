### Traveling Salesman

Traveling Salesman is a widely studied graph theory problem that is solved by using a greedy algorithm. The premise is that you have a graph of cities with certain distances (or weights) between them. The objective is to find the shortest path that will allow you to visit each city once, leaving you at the city in which you began your journey.

In this project, we are going to use our knowledge of graphs and greedy algorithms to solve the problem. Letâ€™s get started!
