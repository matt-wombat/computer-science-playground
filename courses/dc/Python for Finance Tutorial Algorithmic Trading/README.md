## Python For Finance Tutorial For Beginners
A tutorial for beginners on how to get started with Python for Finance. This tutorial was published on the DataCamp Community on the 1st of June 2017. You can read the article [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/finance-python-trading). 

The file that is included in this repository is the Jupyter Notebook that contains the code that I used to write the tutorial. The tutorial is meant to give tailored, in-depth and step-by-step information to beginners on the stock market, how to set up your programming environment, and how to get started with Python's popular data manipulation package `pandas` to do some common financial analyses first and then make a simple trading strategy. Afterwards, the article shows how to backtest the strategy with `pandas` as well as `zipline` and Quantopian, and details how you can improve and evaluate your strategy.
